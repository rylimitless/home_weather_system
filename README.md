Home Weather Station: Know Your Backyard's Breeze
This home weather system keeps you informed about your microclimate, right from your living room. It combines three key parts:

Hardware: A weather station installed outdoors collects real-time data like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Backend:  Data collected by the hardware is transmitted wirelessly to a secure backend system. This backend, often cloud-based, utilizes a database like MongoDB to store the information. This allows you to access historical weather data for your location.

Frontend:  An easy-to-use app or web interface acts as the frontend. This is where you see the magic happen! Real-time weather data is displayed in a clear and concise format, so you can see exactly what's going on outside at a glance.

With this system, you can track trends, analyze past weather patterns, and stay prepared for whatever Mother Nature throws your way.
